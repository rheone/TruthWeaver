# ADR-0002: Evaluation semantics

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Once a rule is compiled, evaluating it against a context needs precise
answers to several coupled questions: how predicates are invoked (sync vs.
async), how term results are reused within one evaluation, in what order
operands are visited, what happens when a term faults mid-evaluation, how
predicates are registered and resolve their own dependencies, and how a rule
gets updated at runtime without downtime or locking. These are treated
together because they constrain each other — for example, memoization is
only sound if term identity is stable and predicates are pure for the
duration of one evaluation, and short-circuit evaluation is only safe if
predicates have no side effects a caller depends on.

## Decision

### Async predicates, required cancellation

```csharp
public interface IPredicate<in TContext>
{
    static abstract PredicateSchema Schema { get; }

    ValueTask<TruthValue> EvaluateAsync(
        TContext context,
        PredicateArguments args,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

Predicates return `ValueTask<TruthValue>` (originally `ValueTask<bool>`; changed by
[ADR-0005](0005-strong-k3-language-surface.md) decision 15 so a predicate can answer
`Unknown` directly) and take a required `CancellationToken`
(no default-cancellation-token overload on the evaluation path). This engine's
primary consumers do I/O — a database lookup, an HTTP call, a config read via
`IOptions<T>` — and async is the only choice that doesn't force every
predicate author into a blocking call or a bespoke sync/async split. A purely
synchronous predicate (e.g. reading an in-memory flag) costs nothing extra
via `ValueTask.FromResult(...)`; forcing the reverse — wrapping IO-bound work
behind a synchronous facade — is materially worse.

Arguments are exposed through a small, non-generic `PredicateArguments`
accessor (`args.GetString("role")`, `args.GetInt64("days")`, etc.) validated
against the predicate's declared `PredicateSchema` at *compile* time, so a
missing or mistyped argument is a compile diagnostic
([ADR-0003](0003-rule-syntax-and-serialization.md)), never a runtime failure
inside `EvaluateAsync`.

A predicate signals a fault by throwing (see
[ADR-0001](0001-kleene-failure-model.md)); it may also return `TruthValue.Unknown`
directly ([ADR-0005](0005-strong-k3-language-surface.md) decision 15, which makes the
"explicit unknown pathway" a plain return value that records no fault) for authors who want to express indeterminacy
without treating it as exceptional, but throwing on genuine failure (a
timeout, a connection failure) is the expected, low-friction path and
requires no special handling by the predicate author beyond letting the
exception propagate naturally.

### Cancellation and timeout: fault, or propagate

Two different things can stop an in-flight evaluation, and they are deliberately not treated the
same:

- **The evaluation's own token** — the `CancellationToken` the caller passed to `EvaluateAsync`, or
  the token `EvaluationOptions.Timeout` is linked into — is the one thing that ends the whole
  evaluation. When *that* token is the one cancelled, `OperationCanceledException` propagates out of
  `EvaluateAsync`, exactly as it would from any other cancellable async API. A caller who cancelled, or
  a timeout that elapsed, asked for the call to stop; a `Decision` whose `Result` is `Unknown` would
  look like an ordinary predicate failure and hide that.
- **A predicate's or a data source's own cancellation or timeout** — it throws
  `OperationCanceledException` or `TimeoutException` on its own initiative (its own internal deadline,
  its own linked `CancellationTokenSource`) while the evaluation's token is still live — is a fault like
  any other exception: the term becomes `Unknown`, a `Fault` is recorded (see
  [ADR-0001](0001-kleene-failure-model.md)), and evaluation continues. The predicate or source is
  reporting "I could not answer," not "stop the whole evaluation," and nothing upstream can tell those
  two cases apart except by checking which token fired.

The rule is mechanical, and `Evaluator` applies it identically to a predicate invocation and to a data
source `QueryAsync` call: an `OperationCanceledException` propagates only when the evaluation's own
`CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested` is true at the point it is caught. Every other case —
every `TimeoutException`, and an `OperationCanceledException` thrown while the evaluation's token is
not cancelled — is an ordinary fault, exactly like any other thrown exception.

### Term identity and per-evaluation memoization

A term's identity is the normalized predicate name plus its arguments sorted
by name and canonically value-formatted (full rule in
[CONTEXT.md](../../CONTEXT.md#term-identity)). Within a single evaluation,
each distinct term identity is evaluated **at most once**, regardless of how
many places in the tree reference it — the second and subsequent references
reuse the memoized `TruthValue`.

This is scoped to **one evaluation only**. The predicate-author contract is
exactly: *the same term identity returns the same answer within a single
evaluation*. Nothing is claimed or cached across evaluations — a predicate
reading a slowly-changing database row or `IOptions<T>` may legitimately
return a different answer next time `Evaluate` is called, and that is
correct behavior, not a bug. Ambient state such as a clock is entirely the
predicate's concern (e.g. an `IsToday` predicate reads `TimeProvider`
internally); the engine has no special knowledge of time and makes no
determinism claim spanning evaluations.

### Left-to-right, short-circuit, no implicit concurrency

> **Extended by [ADR-0005](0005-strong-k3-language-surface.md):** `COALESCE` and `If` also
> short-circuit (a known value, or the needed branch for a definite condition), and `NAND`/`NOR`
> evaluate both operands. The rule below describes `AND`/`OR`, which are unchanged.

Operands are evaluated strictly left to right. `AND` stops as soon as a
`False` is reached (see the Kleene tables in
[ADR-0001](0001-kleene-failure-model.md) — `False AND anything` is `False`
regardless of `Unknown`); `OR` stops as soon as a `True` is reached. This is
observable in the trace: unevaluated nodes are recorded explicitly as
`NotEvaluated`, not omitted, so a "why was I denied" trace shows what *didn't*
run rather than silently having a hole where the reader would expect an
entry.

Sibling operands are **not** evaluated concurrently in v1. Concurrency would
be a real latency win for independent I/O-bound terms, but it costs
deterministic fault ordering, straightforward cancellation, and a trace that
reads in the order the rule was written — all correctness/debuggability
properties this v1 prioritizes over the latency win. This is deliberately
left as an additive `EvaluationOptions` knob for later, since it becomes safe
purely as a consequence of predicates already being contractually pure.

An `EvaluationMode.Exhaustive` option evaluates every reachable term (no
short-circuit) and collects every fault, for diagnostic/support use. This
mode never changes `Decision.Result` — it only changes which terms run and
what the trace/fault list contains — and that invariant must hold for any
future change to this mode.

### Faults absorb, they don't abort

When a predicate faults, the evaluator does not abort the evaluation. It
records the `Fault` and treats that term as `Unknown`, and evaluation
continues wherever the operator tables permit a determinate result to still
be reached (see [ADR-0001](0001-kleene-failure-model.md)). This is the entire
point of using Kleene logic: a transient database blip that turns out to be
irrelevant to the final answer (e.g. it's one operand of an `OR` whose other
operand is `True`) should not turn into a denial.

`EvaluationOptions.FaultBudget` (default: unlimited) lets a caller opt into
fail-fast behavior — e.g. set to `1` during a known outage so the first
fault aborts evaluation immediately rather than continuing to spend I/O
trying to route around it. This is a caller-level operational choice, not a
change to the engine's default semantics.

### Predicate registration and dependency lifetimes

The `PredicateRegistry` stores **descriptors** — name, `PredicateSchema`,
and either an implementation type or a stateless lambda — not instances.
Class-based predicates are resolved from a per-evaluation `IServiceProvider`
supplied alongside the context, so a predicate with a **scoped** dependency
(a `DbContext`, a per-request `HttpClient`) resolves correctly on every
evaluation rather than being captured once at registration time, which would
be wrong the moment a rule outlives the scope it was compiled in.

Registration is **explicit only** — a builder API, plus the lambda form for
stateless predicates. No attribute scanning / assembly scanning: it is
implicit magic, it works against trimming and AOT, and it contradicts this
repo's own rule against unnecessary abstraction. A rule referencing a
predicate name with no matching registration is a compile-time diagnostic
(see [ADR-0003](0003-rule-syntax-and-serialization.md)), not a runtime
surprise.

### Rule lifecycle: compile-and-swap, not a framework

The library owns **compilation and evaluation only** — not rule storage,
scheduling, or invalidation. `CompiledRule` is immutable and thread-safe.
Runtime rule changes (a rule edited in a database, a config file reloaded)
are handled entirely by the *consuming application*: detect the change,
call `RuleCompiler.Compile` again, and assign the result to the field/
property holding the active `CompiledRule`. Because the assignment is a
single reference swap, in-flight evaluations finish against the rule they
started with, new evaluations pick up the new one, and no lock is needed.

The library deliberately does **not** ship an `IRuleSource`, a rule cache, or
change-token plumbing in v1 — that is exactly the kind of scope creep that
turns a rules engine into an unwanted framework. The compile-and-swap pattern
is documented (here and in the README) as the recommended integration, not
built as API surface.

### Persisted rules and compile failures

`RuleCompiler.Compile` never throws for an authoring error (unknown
predicate, bad argument type, malformed syntax); it returns a
`CompilationResult` — nullable `CompiledRule` plus a list of diagnostics.
The intended integration is a form-submission model: an editing/persistence
path calls `Compile`, and if there are `Error`-severity diagnostics, the
save is rejected and the diagnostics are surfaced to whoever is editing the
rule (with source spans, so an editor can underline the offending token) —
**the previously persisted, previously-compiled rule remains active and
nothing new is written**. A rule that successfully compiles once cannot
later become invalid without an explicit new write, so the running system
never silently starts failing to compile a rule it already accepted.

`CompilationMode.Lenient` is available for a different, legitimate scenario:
multiple services sharing one rule store with different predicate sets
registered per service. There, an unknown predicate is not necessarily a
bug in the rule, so it compiles as a permanent `Unknown` fault on that term
rather than an error — but this mode is never used on the write/persistence
path, only on read paths where cross-service predicate mismatch is an
accepted topology.

### Resource limits

`CompilerOptions` bounds are enforced during compilation so that a rule
authored by an admin — potentially against a database, not reviewed as code
— cannot pathologically hang a request thread: max tree depth (default 32),
max node count (default 512), and a cap on the number of distinct terms
subject to BDD-based constant/contradiction analysis (default 20; beyond the
cap, analysis is skipped and reported as an `Info` diagnostic — never
silently claimed as "not constant," and never left to hang). All bounds are
overridable via `CompilerOptions`, defaulted to values no legitimate rule is
expected to approach. `EvaluationOptions` similarly exposes an overall
evaluation timeout, linked into the caller's `CancellationToken`, default
off.

I/O volume and sequencing *inside* a single predicate (e.g. a predicate that
happens to make several sequential HTTP calls) is out of scope for these
limits and is the predicate author's responsibility, per the
predicate-author contract in [CONTEXT.md](../../CONTEXT.md).

## Consequences

- Evaluations are cheap to repeat (per-evaluation memoization + short-circuit
  + a shared `CompiledRule`), which is the intended answer to "evaluate this
  rule for many candidate users" — the caller loops, rather than the engine
  offering a bulk/partial-evaluation API in v1 (deferred, see
  [CONTEXT.md](../../CONTEXT.md#deferred)).
- The trace is an accurate, literal record of what was and wasn't evaluated,
  which makes it trustworthy for "why was this denied" without being
  misleading about short-circuited branches.
- Runtime rule updates require zero engine-provided infrastructure, at the
  cost of the consuming application being responsible for detecting changes
  and triggering recompilation — an explicit, intended trade-off.
- A rule that fails to compile can never be silently persisted; validation
  and persistence are inseparable by construction.
