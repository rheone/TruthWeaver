# 02: Repair local gates

**What to build:** `dotnet csharpier check .` runs to completion locally and in CI. Repair the dangling directory junction under the agent-skills folder that points at the old Boolean-Rules-Engine path (the crash cause), and add the missing final newline to the central package props file. A .csharpierignore alone does not help because CSharpier's version-check pass ignores ignore files (research item 6a).

**Blocked by:** None (can start immediately)

**Status:** done

- [x] `dotnet csharpier check .` exits 0 from the repo root
- [x] The junction no longer points at a missing path (or is removed if it is only a local artifact; say which)
- [x] Issues-log rows 1 and 3 are updated with the resolution
- [x] Built test-first where code changes; the full validation set in CLAUDE.md passes (build, test, csharpier check src tests benchmarks, format --verify-no-changes with no new diagnostics in touched files, roslynator per project)

## Comments

The junction was a local artifact (not tracked); the owner repaired it locally, so it is not a repository change. `csharpier check .` and `dotnet format --verify-no-changes --severity info` both exit 0; the Directory.Packages.props final newline landed in 00cfd18. Issues-log rows 1 and 3 updated. Build 0 warnings, 2069 tests pass.
